How to run program:

    Once in the directory, run the code "flask --app main run" (*assuming the necessary files are downloaded*)
    To use the application, Navigate to the route "Weather Searcher"
    Choose a type:
        "Real Time"
        "Forecast" : up to 5 Days in advance 
        "History" : yesterday's Weather
    Type in a location or a ZipCode

Future work:
    History: 
        As of right now, the History offers more than just the day before. Like Forecast, I believe that History allows you to
        pick up to 20 days past. This is something that could be implemented for Future work

    Weather Codes:
        for Real Time, the Weather Code does not account to whether or not it is AM or PM, and would show a sunny image during
        a clear night. (Still technically correct since it means that the skies are clear)

    Data Display:
        Could probably make the way that the Data more presentable
        Different explanations of the different weather keys.

    Misc:
        Activities to do depending on the current weather.
            Ex: Hot / Sunny : Go to the beach.
                Cloudy : Board Games, Painting, etc..

Oliva Avalos:
I worked in the about page, had troubele working in my cst205finalproject folder errors like modules, and flask erros, so I had to work on it on my cst205 file. In the about.html file I cretaed the title, what the app usage is how to use it. I was working on an about the creators but unfortunatly didn't get to finish. The paragraph as well as any other text should be center. Since we had trouble and tried to push our work into github for almost 2hrs. We let Avner know about our issues, letting us know we could comment this. If we had extra time we would have added a wave time to our website. I would have also wanted to add background music to my part of the website as a welcoming beat to it. Since I didn't about the creators if I would have I would have liked to add images of every creator whith a bottom description about themselves as well as how we came out with the idea.
