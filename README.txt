Future work:
    History: 
        As of right now, the History offers more than just the day before. Like Forecast, I believe that History allows you to
        pick up to 20 days past. This is something that could be implemented for Future work

    Weather Codes:
        for Real Time, the Weather Code does not account to whether or not it is AM or PM, and would show a sunny image during
        a clear night. (Still technically correct since it means that the skies are clear)

    Data Display:
        Could probably make the way that the Data more presentable
        Different explanations of the different weather keys.

    Misc:
        Activities to do depending on the current weather.
            Ex: Hot / Sunny : Go to the beach.
                Cloudy : Board Games, Painting, etc..
